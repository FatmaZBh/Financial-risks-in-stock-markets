## What to open from the repository
A lot of this repo is just us pushing different parts of the code together so it is a bit messy. We put everything into one single older versions folder. The only files you actually need are:
- FINAL_FINALVERSION.ipynb
- report.pdf
The preview of the report might not load directly on github, but when you download the repository as a zip (or directly the report individually) there is no problem to read it.
- and the messy_datasets_new_version directory

## What _not_ to open from the repository
- The older_versions folder

## How to run the code
- Download this repository as a zip and extract it
- Open the entire folder in VS Code (the notebook and datasets need to be in the same folder)
- Run all cells

## What does the report contain ?
Our report covers everything from the question and original datasets, our methods, results, limitations and difficulties, and the key terms and formulas needed to understand our project and the insights given.
Most terms are summarily explained in the notebook as well, in commentary or in markdown, so the user at least knows what we are talking about.
